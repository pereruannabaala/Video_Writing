# OpenCV Video Processing - Open in Colab

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for video processing, including reading, writing, and encoding video files. The notebook processes a sample video, captures frames, and converts the output format for better compatibility.

## Features
- Downloading Assets: Automatically downloads and extracts video files for processing.
- Reading Videos: Uses cv2.VideoCapture() to read video frames from a file.
- Displaying Frames: Shows a frame using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow().
- Writing Video Output: Saves processed video files in AVI and MP4 formats.
- Encoding Conversion: Converts XVID encoded MP4 to H.264 for better playback.
- YouTube Video Embedding: Displays an example YouTube video for reference.
