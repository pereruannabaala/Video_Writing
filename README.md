# OpenCV Video Processing - Open in Colab

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for video processing, including reading, writing, and encoding video files. The notebook processes a sample video, captures frames, and converts the output format for better compatibility.

## Features
- Downloading Assets: Automatically downloads and extracts video files for processing.
- Reading Videos: Uses ``cv2.VideoCapture()`` to read video frames from a file.
- Displaying Frames: Shows a frame using ``matplotlib.pyplot.imshow()``.
- Writing Video Output: Saves processed video files in AVI and MP4 formats.
- Encoding Conversion: Converts XVID encoded MP4 to H.264 for better playback.
- YouTube Video Embedding: Displays an example YouTube video for reference.

## Usage
1. Run the notebook in Colab by clicking the Open in Colab button.
2. Follow the code sections to read, display, and process video files.
3. Modify and experiment with different video sources and encoding format
